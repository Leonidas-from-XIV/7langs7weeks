Seven Languages in Seven Weeks
==============================

This repository contains listings and my solutions to the problems presented in
Bruce A. Tate's book "[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks][book]: A Pragmatic Guide
to Learning Programming Languages". They might not always be the cleanest, but
I tried to go for short, expressive solutions that try to leverage the features
of the language well.

I also tend to [blog][blog] about the topics that were presented and summarize
my own opinions on the languages I encountered. If you are interested in that
kind of stuff, you might want to take a look.

License-wise, well, I added one, because otherwise reusing code could get
difficult, so I picked something permissive that you can integrate in your own
stuff if you like.
